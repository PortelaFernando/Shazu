    <h4><strong>PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.</strong></h4>

<p>This Instructor Policy, which is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use, sets out the terms and conditions under which Instructors (“you”) may deliver Courses to Students through the Services on or through the Teachable Sites. By using the Services to create and/or offer any Course on or through the Sites, whether in exchange for a registration fee or free of charge, you acknowledge and agree to this Instructor Policy and fully agree to the terms and conditions herein. If you do not agree with the following policies, do not create any Course or offer any Course through the Services. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy.
<br><br></p>

<h2>Your Relationship with Teachable, Instructors, and Students</h2>

<p>To be eligible to be an Instructor through the Services, you must be at least 18 years old, or, if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you must have your parent or guardian’s permission to be an Instructor through the Services. You represent and warrant that you have obtained such permission. Children under the age of 13 may not use the Sites or Services or register for an account. Instructors are not Teachable employees. Instructors have the authority to decide, among other things, how to write their curricula and teach their Courses, subject to the terms generally applicable to all Users as stated in our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and this Instructor Policy. Instructors are paid their Course registration fees according to their selected payment preferences as described in the section titled Pricing Your Course below, and are not entitled to any compensation in addition to their registration fees, including without limitation, a salary or other employment benefits. This relationship is at will and may be terminated by either you or us at any time, for any reason or for no reason, with or without notice. Your continued use of the Services and access to the Sites, including your ability to teach or administer your Courses, is subject to your adherence to Teachable’s Terms of Use and this Instructor Policy and Teachable may terminate your ability to use the Services at any time.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that you do not have any exclusive claim to a particular topic or curriculum by offering a particular past or present Course through the Services, that you will interact, if at all, with other Instructors in a professional manner, and that at no time may you interfere with or otherwise prevent other Instructors from providing their Courses.</p>

<p>Students enroll in Courses offered through our Services on our Sites, and do not have a direct contractual relationship with any Instructor by virtue of their enrollment in its Course(s). Students are Teachable Users, and not customers or students belonging to any Instructor. As Teachable Users, our treatment of Students and their personal information is subject to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, and as such, if and when we provide you with any information regarding any Student, including but not limited to Personally Identifiable Information, it is solely to facilitate your provision of the Course to that Student and you agree to treat such information with the utmost care and to reasonably protect such information from unauthorized use or disclosure. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Teachable from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation or breach by you or arising from or related to your use or misuse of Student information.
<br><br>      </p>

<h2>Your Courses</h2>

<p>Instructors may only use the Services to teach Courses and offer instructional and educational services to Students, and for no other business purpose. By using Teachable’s Sites and Services to offer their Courses, Instructors’ behavior and the quality of Instructors’ teaching reflects upon Teachable and our brand. In every instance, Instructors must be responsive and provide a high quality of service to their Students.</p>

<p>Your Courses, curriculum, and materials may not contain, relate to in a manner that causes or promotes, or enable any of the following: illegal behavior; violence or sexually explicit content; the fabrication or use of any weapon; promotion of hate speech; the intentional misleading, deceiving, demeaning, or harming of any person or entity; or anything else that Teachable deems, in our sole discretion, to be offensive or inappropriate. In connection with teaching any Course or providing Course material, you may not provide, broadcast, or disseminate any inappropriate, offensive, racist, hateful, sexist, pornographic, false, misleading, incorrect, infringing, defamatory, or libelous content or information.</p>

<p>Each Instructor is solely responsible for any and all Content that it uploads, transmits, or posts to the Sites or uses, offers, or disseminates in teaching its Courses. Your Courses, including any part of the curriculum or materials provided, shall not infringe or misappropriate any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party. For any Content you provide in connection with the Courses, you agree that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use such materials, and possess the right and ability to sublicense those rights in connection with your license to Teachable as discussed below, without requiring Teachable to obtain any licenses or pay any royalties to any third party.
<br><br></p>

<h2>Pricing Your Course</h2>

<p>Instructors may offer Courses free of charge, for a one-time purchase, a recurring subscription, or on a payment plan. Instructors are solely responsible for determining the prices charged for their respective Courses. Instructors may also opt to sell a recurring membership to their entire portfolio of Courses by bundling Courses together and setting it to a pricing plan. For any Course or bundle of Courses, Instructors may offer tiered pricing whereby they include extra products or services, either through the Services or outside of Teachable. A full explanation of pricing features is provided on the Teachable Support site under Pricing Your Course:</p>

<p><a href="https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219442088-Overview-of-Course-Pricing-Options">https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219442088-Overview-of-Course-Pricing-Options</a>.</p>

<p>Instructors may process payments through Teachable’s default payment gateway or through a Custom Payment Gateway through Stripe or Paypal.<br>
<br><br></p>

<h3>Teachable’s Payment Gateway</h3>

<p>When Instructors opt for Teachable’s payment gateway, Teachable processes all Student payments and distribute payouts to you directly on the first business day of each month. Instructors must honor requests for a refund within the first 30 days of purchase if the Instructor uses the Teachable platform to handle payments, which means that Teachable holds funds for at least 30 days before releasing them to Instructors. When an Instructor uses Teachable’s gateway to process payments for their Courses, Teachable automatically deducts a processing fee (2.9% of the payment amount, plus $0.30 USD per transaction), as well as author payments, affiliate commissions, etc. before issuing payment.
<br><br></p>

<h3>Custom Payment Gateways</h3>

<p>Instructors on the Professional, High Volume, and Enterprise plans may opt to set up a custom payment gateway through which the payment partners will process Student transactions. These transactions are through the third-party payment gateway, and as such are outside of the scope of your relationship with Teachable. Payouts are distributed according to the third-party payment service’s policies and procedures, and are not subject to Teachable’s 30-day refund policy or payment hold. Course fees are not subject to Teachable’s transaction fees, though may be subject to fees by the third-party payment service. Teachable does not have the access or ability to make deductions from transaction fees processed through third-party payment gateways to pay your authors and/or affiliates, and instead, records the amounts that you owe them in the transactions report so Instructors can make the payments on their own.</p>

<p>For information about the taxes to which you may be subject, see the Teachable Support article titled Understanding Taxes as a School Owner, Author, or Affiliate:</p>

<p><a href="https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/231807527-Understanding-Taxes-as-a-School-Owner-Author-or-Affiliate">https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/231807527-Understanding-Taxes-as-a-School-Owner-Author-or-Affiliate</a>.</p>

<p>A country from which a Student purchases a Course may require Teachable to remit a Value Added Tax (VAT). For those using Teachable’s payment gateway, VAT is automatically applied during checkout. For those using a custom payment gateway, VAT will always be charged unless both Stripe and PayPal gateways have been set up. For more information about VAT, see the Teachable Support article titled Working With and Understanding VAT:</p>

<p><a href="https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/223306588-Working-With-and-Understanding-VAT">https://support.teachable.com/hc/en-us/articles/223306588-Working-With-and-Understanding-VAT</a>.</p>

<h2>Rights We Grant to You</h2>

<p>The Sites and Services are Teachable’s property. We grant to you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to make use of the Services, which shall remain in effect unless and until you terminate your subscription or Teachable terminates your subscription or access to the Services. The Services and Teachable’s software applications are licensed, not sold, to you, and Teachable and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Teachable software applications and Services even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, and/or other relevant devices. All Teachable trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Teachable brand are the sole property of Teachable or its licensors. Except for the rights expressly granted to you in our Terms of Use or this Instructor Policy, Teachable grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Sites or Services, their features, or access thereto.<br>
<br><br></p>

<h2>License to Teachable</h2>

<p>As stated in our Terms of Use, specifically the section titled Content, Licenses &amp; Permissions, while Teachable does not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Sites and provide the Services, now and in the future. For example, when an Instructor makes Course materials available to its Students through the Sites or a Student communicates with an Instructor on a discussion forum, Teachable needs a license from those Users to display their Content on the Sites, as well as the right to sublicense that User Content to our other Users so that they can view that User Content. Therefore, by posting or distributing Content to or through the Sites, each User grants to Teachable, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable, worldwide license and right to use, display, publicly perform, reproduce, distribute, publish, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works from, and otherwise use and exploit such User Content that you upload, transmit, or post on the Sites or through the Services, in the manner in and for the purposes for which the Sites from time to time uses such User Content. For a full scope of the license, see our Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Furthermore, so that Teachable can monitor its Services for quality control and to deliver, market, and promote the Sites and Services, Instructors grant to Teachable permission to record all or part of any Course and the right to use their name, likeness, image, and/or voice in connection with the offer, sale, delivery, or promotion of the Sites, Services, and Courses taught by any Teachable Instructor. In doing so, Instructors waive all rights of privacy, publicity, artist&#39;s moral rights, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection therewith to the extent permissible under applicable law.<br>
<br><br></p>

<h2>Your Teachable Subscription</h2>

<p>Teachable charges Instructors certain fees to access certain features and functionalities of the Sites and the Services set to a multitiered subscription structure, while other features of the Services are offered to you free-of-charge. Teachable’s fees are detailed more fully on the Pricing webpage (<a href="pricing/index.html">https://teachable.com/pricing/</a>).</p>

<p>Paid subscriptions can be purchased either by paying a monthly or annual subscription fee, and when you registered for a paid subscription, you agree to get access to the for-pay functionalities of the Services immediately. Your payment to Teachable will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A PAID PLAN, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR TEACHABLE ACCOUNT OR TERMINATE YOUR TEACHABLE ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE BILLING PERIOD. Teachable reserves the right to change the price for any paid subscription plan from time to time, and will communicate any price change to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for paid subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next billing period following the date of the price change. As permitted by law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Services after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the price change by unsubscribing from the Services prior to the price change going into effect. You may terminate your paid subscription for any reason or no reason, after which you will be downgraded to a free account.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may offer trials of paid subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate. Teachable reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a free trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a free trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law. AT THE END OF SUCH FREE TRIAL, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FREE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT METHOD.<br>
<br><br></p>

<h2>Closing Your Account</h2>

<p>If you choose to close your Teachable account or otherwise stop offering your Course(s) on the Sites, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make any remaining scheduled payments due and owing to you. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Teachable may continue to make your Course(s) available and accessible to Students who have previously enrolled in those respective Courses.<br>
<br><br></p>

<h2>Changes to the Instructor Policy</h2>

<p>We may review and update this Instructor Policy from time to time in our sole discretion and it is each Instructor’s responsibility to keep abreast of those changes. All changes are effective immediately when posted. As such, your continued use of the Sites or Services after Teachable makes changes to this Instructor Policy is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this webpage periodically for updates. In addition, Teachable will notify Instructors of any material or significant changes to this Instructor Policy by placing a notice on the Sites and notifying registered Instructors via email. The most recent version of the Instructor Policy supersedes all previous iterations of the Instructor Policy, including that version of the Instructor Policy in effect at the time that you registered as an Instructor or began offering your Course(s) through the Services.<br>
